# REV Offline Web App

Welcome to the REV Offline Web App. The goal of this project is to build an app
that can easily be ported to multiple operating systems and used offline for
reading the REV bible found [here](https://www.revisedenglishversion.com).
Currently we need a lot of work on the styling of the app, and customization.

This app is currently being hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://rev-offline-8go5g.ondigitalocean.app/).

## Currently Shelved

This project is currently shelved.
I intend to resurrect this project using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). That will be another project however.

## Features to implement

- Improve styling of scripture verses.
- Add custom themes.
- ~~Implement a better back button so going back from the commentary will get
  you back to the bible.~~ **DONE**
- Implement infinite scrolling or paging with swiping or navigation buttons.
  - Currently using navigation buttons
